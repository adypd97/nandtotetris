A HDL overview:
Two parts:
1. HEADER: describes the name of chip and its interface(I/O)
2. PARTS : defines the topology of all the other chips and how they manipulate
           I/O to get the chip in HEADER.

		   Statements: describe the lower-level chip and how they connect to 
		   other parts. Internal and external pins together describe the connecti
		   vity of the design for the chip.
